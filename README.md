# 🚀 Real-Time Sign Language Detector

This project is a **Real-Time Sign Language Detector** that uses deep learning to recognize hand gestures and translate them into text. The model is trained to identify different sign language gestures using a neural network and is deployed to provide real-time predictions. ✋🤖

## ✨ Features
- 🎥 **Real-time Gesture Detection**: Uses a webcam to capture hand movements.
- 🧠 **Deep Learning Model**: Pre-trained `action.h5` model for recognizing gestures.
- 🖥️ **Python & OpenCV-based**: Utilizes OpenCV for real-time video processing.
- 🔥 **TensorFlow/Keras Implementation**: Uses deep learning to classify sign language gestures.
- 🏆 **User-friendly Interface**: Provides a clear output of detected signs.

## 🛠️ Installation
To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

### 📌 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 📸 OpenCV
- 🤖 TensorFlow
- 🔢 NumPy
- 🖐️ MediaPipe (for hand tracking, if applicable)

### 🚀 Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-sign-language-detector.git
   cd real-time-sign-language-detector
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the detector:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🏗️ Model Details
- The trained model **`action.h5`** is a deep learning model built using **TensorFlow/Keras**.
- It has been trained on a dataset of sign language gestures.
- The model predicts sign language actions in real time. ⚡

## 🎯 Usage
1. Run the script using `python main.py`.
2. Ensure the webcam is turned on. 📷
3. Perform the sign language gestures in front of the camera. ✋
4. The model will predict and display the corresponding text in real time. 🔡

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- 📈 Extend the dataset for better accuracy.
- 🖥️ Integrate a GUI for an improved user experience.
- ✌️ Implement multi-hand tracking for enhanced detection.
